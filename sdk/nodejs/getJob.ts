/**
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * Getting the existing cluster id of specific databricks.Job by name or by id:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as databricks from "@pulumi/databricks";
 *
 * const this = databricks.getJob({
 *     jobName: "My job",
 * });
 * export const clusterId = _this.then(_this => _this.jobSettings?.settings?.newCluster?.numWorkers);
 * ```
 * ## Related Resources
 *
 * The following resources are used in the same context:
 *
 * * databricks.getJobs data to get all jobs and their names from a workspace.
 * * databricks.Job to manage [Databricks Jobs](https://docs.databricks.com/jobs.html) to run non-interactive code in a databricks_cluster.
